A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

! You already have nine parameters.

I'm going to ignore the # sign you just used.

! Undefined control sequence.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Use of \make doesn't match its definition.
<argument> ...ip 1.5em\ifMCM @opt@abstract\make @a

l.249 }
       
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

! Extra \fi.
<argument> ...\make @abstract \make @keywords \fi

I'm ignoring this; it doesn't match any \if.
